dserve README
==============

dserve is a tool for performing REST queries from WhiteDB using a cgi
protocol over http. Results are given in the json or csv format.

dservehttps is a version of dserve using https instead of http.

nsmeasure is a tool for measuring server speed.

For details see http://whitedb.org/server/

Run dserver in one of three ways:

* a cgi program under a web server, connecting like
  http://myhost.com/dserve?op=search&from=0&count=5  
* as a standalone http(s) server, passing a port number as a single argument, like
  dserve 8080
  and connecting like
  http://localhost:8080/dserve?op=search&from=0&count=5
  or, for dservehttps compiled with USE_OPENSSL
  dservehttps 8081 conf.txt
  https://localhost:8081/dserve?op=search&from=0&count=5
* from the command line, passing a cgi-format, urlencoded query string
  as a single argument, like
  dserve 'op=search&from=0&count=5'
  
Use the provided Makefile or compile.sh or compile.bat for compiling dserve. 

Use and modify the code for creating your own data servers for WhiteDB.
