Wgandalf README
===============

Wgandalf is a rule-enriched main memory database using shared memory.

Its focus is on efficiency and simplicity. 

The wgandalf core is usable as a library for common data
storage, also between different concurrent processes.

The additional packages under development make wgandalf also:

  - an rdf database

  - an xml database

  - object storage for different languages

  - a rule engine 
  
  - an automated reasoner

Wgandalf is written wholly in plain C.

Read other documentation files (in big caps) or look
into the doc folder for browsable documentation.

Wgandalf is licenced under GPL v 3. Additional licences
might be available, ask the authors (see AUTHORS).
